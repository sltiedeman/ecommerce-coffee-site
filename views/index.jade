            p Tiedemann Roasters is a boutique coffee shop that specializes in selling only the finest coffee in the world.  No matter how successful we may become we will always consider ourselves to be a boutique outfit. Why you may ask? When someone thinks about a boutique company they associate it with a special product.  They are willing to spend a bit more for it and when their friends ask them where they got their coffee they will be able to say with pride it came from a boutique company. In that moment they will have the satisfaction of knowing their friends think they must be rich for drinking such a fine product. Naturally, everyone will think it tastes better because of it.
            p It is with a deep sense of responsibility that we source our product and great care is taken in how we deliver it to you, our most valued customer.  Even though our coffee beans come from the exact same fields as much cheaper coffee, it is our mission to make you think it is far better than anyone could possibly think it is. We accomplish this with sophisticated packaging and overpaying on designer labels.  Only through all of this hard work are you able to have the conviction to pull out your wallet and purchase with great pride and smugness.
